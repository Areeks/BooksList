# This Java code defines a Book class that represents a book with a name and a publication date, and a Books class that manages a list of Book objects.

The Book class has a constructor that takes a string parameter representing the book name, and an integer parameter representing the publication date. It also has two methods: getDate() to get the publication date, and getName() to get the book name.

The Books class has a constructor that initializes a LinkedList to store Book objects. It has two methods: addBook() to add a new Book object to the list, and GetDateBooks() to print the name and publication date of all books in the list that have a publication date greater than a given date.

The main method creates a Books object, adds several Book objects to it using the addBook() method, and then calls the GetDateBooks() method to print the name and publication date of all books in the list that have a publication date greater than 2000.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of classes and lists in Java, and how to create a custom class with its own methods and data fields.
